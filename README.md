### Hi there! ☀️🍊

I'm Stina and I am a first-year Javascript-developer student at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg.
I am currently working on a group project with some of my classmates and doing some finishing touches on my old school projects. 
Feel free to check out my profile!

More uploads to come, soon! ✨
